# ✍️ How to Identify and Write Test Cases

Testing is more than just clicking around an app and hoping for the best—it's a structured approach to ensure everything works as expected. 🛠️ Writing test cases is **both an art and a science**, helping testers systematically verify software functionality.

If you've ever wondered **how to write effective test cases** that actually catch bugs and don't just check the obvious stuff—you're in the right place! 🚀

## 🧐 What is a Test Case?

A **test case** is like a recipe for testing. It’s a set of steps, conditions, and expected results that guide testers in verifying whether a software feature is working correctly. In short, it’s a **blueprint** to check if your app behaves the way it should.

### 🔑 Key Components of a Test Case:

Every test case should include these key elements:

- **Test Case ID:** A unique identifier to track the test. (E.g., `LOGIN_001`)
- **Test Description:** A short, clear summary of what the test will verify.
- **Preconditions:** What needs to be set up before running the test. (e.g., “User must be registered.”)
- **Test Steps:** The specific actions needed to execute the test.
- **Test Data:** Any inputs required (e.g., username, password, product IDs).
- **Expected Result:** What the app should do if everything works correctly.
- **Actual Result:** What the app actually did during the test run.
- **Postconditions:** Steps to clean up or reset the state after the test.
- **Status:** Pass or Fail, indicating if the feature works as expected.

## 🎯 Test Cases vs. Test Scenarios: What’s the Difference?

Before diving into writing test cases, let’s understand the difference between **test cases** and **test scenarios**, because they’re often confused. 🤯

| Feature          | Test Case 📝                                    | Test Scenario 🎯                              |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**   | A detailed step-by-step guide on "how" to test. | A high-level description of "what" to test.   |
| **Example**      | "Verify login fails with incorrect password."   | "User should be able to log in successfully." |
| **Focus**        | Specific functionalities and expected outcomes. | Broad user stories or features.               |
| **Detail Level** | Very detailed, including exact steps.           | High-level without step-by-step actions.      |
| **Purpose**      | Helps testers follow precise instructions.      | Helps in brainstorming areas to test.         |

**Example for a login system:**

- **Test Scenario:** "User should be able to log in successfully."
- **Test Cases:**
  1. Enter correct credentials → expect successful login.
  2. Enter wrong credentials → expect error message.
  3. Leave password blank → expect validation error.

## 🏗️ Steps to Write Effective Test Cases

Alright, let's get into it. Writing a good test case isn't just about jotting down random steps—there's a **process** to it:

### 1. 🔍 **Define What to Cover**

Start by identifying **which feature or functionality** you're testing. Break it down into smaller parts to ensure thorough coverage.

**Example:** Testing an e-commerce checkout feature could include:

- Adding an item to the cart.
- Applying a discount code.
- Selecting different payment methods.

---

### 2. 📝 **Make It Clear and Understandable**

Write your test case as if **someone new to the project** could follow it easily. Use simple and concise language.

**Bad Example:**  
“Login with user credentials and check if it's good.”

**Good Example:**  
“1. Go to `example.com/login`.  
2. Enter a valid email `testuser@example.com` and password `password123`.  
3. Click the ‘Login’ button.  
4. Verify that the homepage is displayed.”

---

### 3. 🧠 **Apply Test Design Techniques**

Use structured approaches to test design, such as:

- **Equivalence Partitioning:** Group similar inputs to avoid redundant tests.
- **Boundary Value Analysis:** Test limits (e.g., min/max values).
- **State Transition Testing:** Check system behavior across different states.

---

### 4. 🏷️ **Use Unique Identifiers**

Each test case should have a **unique ID** for easy tracking and reporting.

**Example:**

- `LOGIN_001` - Valid email, valid password
- `LOGIN_002` - Invalid email, valid password

---

### 5. 📋 **Write in the "Given-When-Then" Format (BDD Style)**

A great way to ensure clarity and completeness is to follow the **Given-When-Then** format, often used in Behavior-Driven Development (BDD).

**Example:**

```
Given: The user is on the login page.
When: They enter valid credentials and click 'Login'.
Then: They should be redirected to the dashboard.
```

---

### 6. 🛑 **Include Preconditions and Postconditions**

Preconditions help set up the right environment, and postconditions ensure clean-up.

**Example:**  
**Precondition:** "User must have a registered account."  
**Postcondition:** "User is logged out after the test."

---

### 7. 🎯 **Specify Expected vs. Actual Results**

Always state **what should happen** vs. **what actually happened.** This helps identify failures quickly.

---

### 8. 📊 **Prioritize Based on Criticality**

Some features are more important than others. Prioritize your test cases accordingly, focusing on core functionalities first.

**Example:**

- ✅ High Priority: Payment processing, login.
- ⏳ Low Priority: Profile picture upload.

---

### 9. 🔄 **Make Test Cases Reusable**

Write test cases that can be reused for different test cycles to save time and effort.

---

### 10. ✅ **Review and Get Feedback**

Before running the tests, have peers review your test cases to catch any gaps or ambiguities.
